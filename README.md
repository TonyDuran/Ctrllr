# Ctrllr

"Controller" | A better `ctrl+r` for bash

## About

Ctrllr is a Rust-based CLI tool that improves upon the traditional bash `ctrl+r` command history search. It provides:

- **Version controlled history**: Store your command history in git
- **Taggable commands**: Tag and organize your most-used commands
- **Shareable across devices**: Sync your history across all your machines
- **Interactive TUI**: Built with ratatui for a better search experience

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** - Project is currently being set up

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run
```

Or after building:

```bash
./target/release/ctrllr
```

## Usage

TBD

## Future Goals

- Replace or augment the traditional `ctrl+r` functionality
- Git-based storage backend for version control
- Cross-device synchronization
- Command tagging and categorization
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
